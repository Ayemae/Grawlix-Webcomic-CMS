<h1>Welcome to the Grawlix CMS v1.5</h1>

<p>The Grawlix CMS is a tool that helps you, a comic artist, publish your own website. But if you’re reading this, then you probably knew that. What you might not know is how to get started. This file will help you along.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The Grawlix CMS requires a web host with PHP5 and MySQL. You’ll need a database on the host before you install the system — check your host’s control panel for details. You will also need a code editor like <a href="http://sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, or <a href="http://panic.com/coda/">Coda</a>, and FTP app like <a href="http://filezilla-project.org">FileZilla</a> or <a href="https://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Learn more about <a href="http://www.getgrawlix.com/docs/1/requirements">the requirements</a>.</li>
	<li>New to FTP? Check out our <a href="http://www.getgrawlix.com/docs/1/ftp">quick guide</a>.</li>
	<li>Learn about <a href="http://www.getgrawlix.com/docs/1/web-host">web hosts</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<ol>
	<li>If you haven’t already, then create a MySQL database at your webhost.</li>
	<li>Upload everything that is inside the <span class="path">the grawlix cms v1.5</span> folder to your web host. There’s <em>usually</em> a <span class="path">public_html</span> or <span class="path">htdocs</span> folder in the FTP account — although some, like Dreamhost, have folders named after their domains. Consult your web host for details.</li>
	<li>Visit <span class="path">yoursite.com/firstrun.php</span> (where “yoursite.com” is your webcomic’s URL) and follow the prompts.</li>
	<li>Rename <span class="path">htaccess.txt</span> to <span class="path">.htaccess</span></li>
	<li>(eishiya's note: If you run into server errors with <span class="path">firstrun.php</span>, accessing the admin dashboard, or viewing your new site, check out the comments in <span class="path">.htaccess</span>. You may need to uncomment the RewriteBase line and possibly change it.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Firstrun will give you new code to put into config.php. Upon successful install, you should delete <span class="path">firstrun.php</span> and <span class="path">_admin/_upgrade-to-1.3x.php</span> as a security precaution.</p>

<h2>Upgrading from 1.1 or 1.2</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Make a backup of your site and, if possible, your database.</li>
	<li>Upload the <span class="path">_system</span> and <span class="path">_admin</span> folders to your site, replacing the old versions.</li>
	<li>Upload the <span class="path">functions.inc.php</span> and <span class="path">index.php</span> files into your site’s root directory.</li>
	<li>Copy the new <span class="path">pattern</span> files from any of the included themes into your current theme folder. </li>
	<li>Go to your admin panel and follow the <span class="path">update</span> prompt at the top of the screen.</li>
	<li>When it’s done, delete the script <span class="path">_upgrade-to-1.3.php</span> in your _admin folder.</li>
</ol>

<p>Among other changes and fixes, versions 1.3 and 1.4 make significant changes to <a href="http://www.getgrawlix.com/docs/1/static-pages">static pages</a>. Check out your site’s static pages to be sure everything moved OK.</p>

<!--h2>Customizing the site’s look</h2>

<p>A “theme” is a collection of the files that determine how your site looks. “Tones” are CSS files that modify your theme’s main look. For example, <span class="path">theme.css</span> might control your site’s layout, but <span class="path">tone.autumn.css</span> might control the site’s color — say, to make it seasonal.</p>

<p>This version of the Grawlix CMS comes with three themes: Indotherm, Stick Figure, and Asterisk. <strong>Indotherm</strong> is designed as a fully-fledged look, ready to show you how a Grawlix theme might look. <strong>Stick Figure</strong> is a minimal theme designed to be disassembled and rebuilt as you see fit. <strong>Asterisk</strong> uses more modern, sophisticated CSS techniques and comes with plenty of instructions. Check each theme’s readme file for more info.</p-->
