GRAWLIX NICE-TO-HAVES

archive displays thumbnails, not full images

run-able function to make thumbnails of all pages (on book? on marker?)
- When changing the thumbnail size in Settings, give the option to re-generate all thumbnails.

permalink route with db ID rather than sort order (or some other more permanent identifier than sort order)

allow getting the DB ID in $page

pass the DB ID to Disqus (will require option update)

marker and submarker names to $page class

multiple books (prepared, needs debugging)

allow editing themes within the Grawlix UI

expand the mass scheduler to accommodate more than "every N whatevers"

GUI multi-page uploader
- add scheduler to multi-page uploader

make missing patterns fall back to some default pattern, the same as it does for snippets

image uploader for 'blog'


A way to import page information(titles, publication dates, associated blog posts) from WP exports. 


In Book View, indicate a page set to publish in the future

LIKELY REQUIRES DATABASE CHANGES

option to set the first page as the default page, rather than just a custom page or the latest page

option to automatically make thumbnails of uploaded pages
- add a "generate thumbnail" checkbox on +New Page (no DB change required for this)
- allow setting the default for this checkbox on the Settings page? This would require a DB change. Or maybe we can store its last known value in LocalStorage, without needing a DB change. However, this would be more error-prone as LocalStorage can get cleared out by the user, and some users may use several devices.

GUI support for menu dropdowns

marker for 'pages' not included in comic flow (i.e., hiatus pages)

option to hide submarker title in archive

multiple users

More language-agnostic

Change 'update day' field(?), allow longer strings or parse display on site front-end

css variable editor

change menu text input from varchar(32) to varchar(64)

allow images in main menu
