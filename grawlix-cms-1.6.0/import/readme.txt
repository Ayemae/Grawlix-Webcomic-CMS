# FTP comic page creation

You can upload many — like, hundreds — of comic images at once by adding them to folders within this “import” folder. 

1. Add images to this folder. If you want them sorted into sections (e.g. chapters) then put them into folders *inside* of “import.”
2. Go to “new page” in your admin panel, then tap “create multiple comic pages.”

A few pointers:

**Files are uploaded in order of their filenames.** That means 1.png comes before 2.png, and 2016-01-01.png comes way before 2016-03-02.png.

**Images only.** This importer only accepts PNG, GIF, JPG and SVG files.
