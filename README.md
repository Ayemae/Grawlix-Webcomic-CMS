HOW TO INSTALL:

Download the Grawlix files, and create a MySQL database on your site's host.

With an FTP client*, drag all of the Grawlix files and folders into your main site folder. Among those files is one called "htaccess.txt". Change the name of this one to ".htaccess".

Once you load up the new Grawlix install, it should redirect you to /firstrun. Enter your database credentials, and your user credentials. Grawlix should give you instructions from there!

* Some hosts provide a web FTP client, but some free ones you can download include Cyberduck and Filezilla.
